<h1>Data Cleaning R</h1>

<p>Here are the 
    
    <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/01-data-gathering">two data sets</a>
    
    I used for the data cleaning and this is the 

    <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/data/00-raw-data">cleaned Alchohol/Drug abuse</a>
    datasets after doing all steps below

    </p>
    <p>Here are the 
        <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/01-data-gathering">two cleaned datasets</a>
    
    and this is the <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/02-data-cleaning">code for reference</a>

    <p> <h5>Alcohol datasets </h5>
        It has 465 rows and 7 columns which are Order,State, Substate Region, Small Area Estimate, 95% CI (Lower), 95% CI (Upper), Map Group </p>

    <p><h5> Drug datasets </h5>
        It has 465 rows and 7 columns and has exactly same columns name as Alcohol dataset
    </p>

<h3> Check the if there any Missing values and value validation</h3>
    <p>I checked each columns on both datasets and there is no missing values for both datasets. Also, all the values in both datasets are greater than 0</p>

<h3> Remove unrelated columns, Type casting and Rename the columns  </h3>
    <p> Make the column's name short and easier to read</p>
    <p> Since the "Substate.Region" has duplicated info as State, so I dropped it for both datasets</p>
    <p> Remove the "%" sign for all the cells and convert the all number-like strings to numeric data type</p>

<h3> Visualize the data </h3>
    <p> Alcohol dataset: lower abuse rate vs upper abuse rate</p>
    <img src="../images/outlier_al.PNG" width="500" height="400">
    <p> Drug dataset: lower abuse rate vs upper abuse rate</p>

<h3> Remove outliers</h3>
    <p> By sorting the values in descending order and remove the top a few points</p>
    <p> After removing the ouliers</p>

<Summary> 
    The new Alcohol dataset only has 458 rows and 6 columns and Drug dataset only has 463 rows and 6 columns
    So, Alcohol dataset was reduced by 15.57% and Drug dataset was reduced by 14.65%
</Summary>
<h3> Combine two datasets and label them</h3>
    Since two datasets have exactly same columns, we can combine them into one dataset and add one more column to describe what type of abuse for each record.
