<p>Here are the 
    
    <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/01-data-gathering">two data sets</a>
    
    I used for the data cleaning</p>
    <p>Here are the 
        <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/01-data-gathering">two cleaned datasets</a>
    </p>
    <p> Alchohol datasets 
        <br>
        It has 465 rows and 7 columns which are Order,State,Substate Region,"Small Area Estimate",95% CI (Lower),95% CI (Upper),Map Group </p>

    <p> Drug datasets <br>
        It has 465 rows and 7 columns and has exactly same columns name as Alchohol
    </p>
    <img src="../images/drug_og.PNG" width="500" height="200">
<h3> Check the Missing values in each columns</h3>
    <p>I checked each columns on both datasets and there is no missing values for both datasets</p>
<h3> Remove unrelated columns  </h3>
    <p> Since the "Substate.Region" has duplicated info as State, so I dropped it for both datasets</p>
<h3> Type casting</h3>
    <p> Remove the "%" sign for all the cells and convert the all number-liks strings to nummeric data type</p>
<h3> Visualize the data </h3>
    <p> Alchohol dataset: lower abuse rate vs upper abuse rate</p>

    <p> Drug dataset: lower abuse rate vs upper abuse rate</p>
    <img src="../images/outlier_dr.PNG" width="500" height="400">
<h3> Remove outliers</h3>
    <p> By sorting the values in descending order and remove the top a few points</p>
    <p> After removing the ouliers</p>

<Summary> 
    The new Alchohol dataset only has 458 rows and 6 columns and Drug dataset only has 463 rows and 6 columns
    <br>
    So, Alchohol dataset was reduced by 15.57% and Drug dataset was reduced by 14.65%
