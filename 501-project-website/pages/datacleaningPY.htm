<p>Here is the original 
    <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/01-data-gathering">collection of 2500 tweets</a>
    and this is the  
    <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/data/00-raw-data">cleaned tweets dataset</a>
    after done all the data cleaning procedure shown below. This is the
    <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-yanyanli0/tree/main/codes/02-data-cleaning">code for reference</a>

<h3>Pre-review the data set</h3>
The dataset has 2500 rows and 5 columns. the first column represents the index of each tweet. Since we won't use this for the feature analysis, I will remove this column later.
The Second column represents the post time for each tweet and third column represents the language for the tweets and the last column records the content of each tweet.

<h3> Choose the target columns and filter the data</h3>
<p> Only select rows with Language = 'en' for the feature analysis and remove the index column from the dataset. see below</p>

<h3> Check the validation of values</h3>
See if there any Nan in the dataset and any negative numbers in the Date column.
<h3> Clean the Text data by using CountVectorizer to count each word</h3>
Here is the text data and the word counts, we can see a lot of symbols, meme, punctuations etc. Those things will effect our feature analysis so let's remove then by using the CountVectorizer

<br>
After using CountVectorizer, we can see all the text being split into single word but we still can see a lot of number in each word. So, let's remove them as well

<h3> Remove the stopwords, digits and some non-word strings</h3>
<p>below is the data set after removing all unrelated symbols.</p>

<p> we can see there is no more symbols, stopwords, numbers and non-word strings in the text</p>
<h3> Comparison the Text before and after cleaning </h3>

<h3> Label the dataset based on the tone of text content</Label></h3>
<p> Since I did the "SentimentIntensityAnalyzer" under the exploring data tab, here is how label the data</p>
