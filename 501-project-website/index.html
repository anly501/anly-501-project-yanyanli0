        <h2 >About me</h2>
        <h5>Name:Yanyan Li; GU ID:yl1494 </h5>
       
        <p  style="font: size 15px;">My name is YanYan Li, 
            and I got my bachelor degree at University At Buffalo. 
            Go Bulls! I am a first-generation international student, 
            majoring in Applied Math with a minor in Statistics. 
            I am proud to be graduating from UB this Spring 2022. 
            I am also excited to further my education by pursuing a master
             degree in Georgetown University. I would also like to continue working 
             under a professor to create amazing research so I can grow and develop professionally. 
            </p>  
        <p  style="font: size 15px;">
            Other than continuing my study in the US, I enjoy being a food blogger in my social 
            media. I find great value in showing my international friends the different types of
             foods in the USA. This helps me share my happiness with everyone. I hope by continuing 
             my education in the US I can enjoy the lifestyle I am currently living in right now.
            </p>  
        <p  style="font: size 15px;">
        Every day, I meet new people and learn about their backgrounds, experiences, and interests. 
        I’ve always been curious about why people do the things they do, 
        so in this blog post, I want to share my story and explain why I decided to pursue a degree in architecture. 
        Stay tuned for more posts in the future!
            </p>
            <p  style="font: size 15px;">
            As a Chinese international student, I have been asked many times about my food, 
            studies and hobbies. People are curious about what life is like for students from
             other countries, and especially in the U.S. So here is a little bit about me and
              what I love to do. I love to cook and eat! My favorite cuisine is Sichuan food, which is spicy and flavorful.
               In my spare time, I enjoy playing the guitar and watching Netflix (especially shows with complex plot lines like "Stranger Things"!). 
               Thank you for reading – please feel free to reach out me!

           <h2> Beyond the Classroom </h2>
           <p  style="font: size 15px;"> For as long as I can remember, I have had a passion for numbers; I love all things mathematical numbers can calculate. However, I also have a special interest in Statistics and this is why I decided to also minor in Statistics. I love collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to forecast trends. I also have a special love for mathematics and probability. 
            I would like to combine my passions for statistics and mathematics by furthering my education through the Master program. 
            This Spring, in preparation for my pursuit, I have worked under Professor Naoki Masuda, a mathematical professor 
            at the University at Buffalo. Our research aimed to clarify the influence of genes on diseases. We screened and visualized data, 
            and then leveraged the sophisticated relationships between data obtained by different algorithms to 
            explain and discuss proper meanings behind the data in a multi-dimensional manner. Overall, I would love to continue
             to work on the value of data science in the human health scenario, so I can develop more mature skills in critical thinking, 
             data processing and modeling. </p>
<p  style="font: size 15px;">As for my future future career pursuit, 
    I aspire to work as a data scientist in a big firm for several years after graduation, 
    including but not limited to industries, such as technology, insurance, and investment. 
    I yearn for a chance to acquire more in-depth and practical data knowledge 
    and I hope that I will be able to make brilliant decisions to improve the corporate profits through skilled data analysis. 
    Moreover, networking definitely will be an essential part of my future career. Not only will I meet great people to expand 
    my personal resources, but more importantly, I will actively communicate with them and learn clever ideas from them to enrich myself. 
    I firmly believe that my future work experience will benefit me a lot when running my own start-up investment company. 
    I would like to become a successful entrepreneur like my brother who led his own business group to earn ten times the principal
     in a short period of time through conducting analysis and research on real estate information. In order to to become a more talented person.
